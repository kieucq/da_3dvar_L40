NOTE:
This is the 3DVAR data assimilation system for the Lorenz 40-var system. 
The system is designed solely for pedagogical purposes, and so no support 
is provided. Users will take full responsibility for their use, so long 
as it is not for the commercial purposes.

REMARK:
1. The system only supports PGI/Intel Fortran compiler at the moment. For
   MPI run, only PGI is supported.
2. Only a certain type of OSSE designs are supported (see obs/obs.f90)
3. Intel fortram compiler has a much longer runtime as compared to PGI!!!
4. The cost function minimizer employs an external lib for the conjugate
   gradient method.
5. The code is hardwired with a fixed 1000 step integration, obs err = 0.1
   bgd err = 0.3, number of obs = 40, and 21 DA cycles. Need to learn how to 
   adjust these parameters as a part of learning the code instead of running 
   it like a black box.

INSTALLATION:
1. Edit the installation file: install.sh and select the Fortran compiler
        as well as the main directory that contains this system.
2. Type: sh ./install.sh. A successful compilation should produce 7 exe
        files. Any missing executable files would give an error message.

HOW TO RUN:
1. cd run and edit run.sh to choose the options for DA cycling settings as well
        as 3DVAR namelist configuration
3. Run: sh ./run.sh
3. Go to "ana" and check some diagnostic analysis (see, e.g., ana.txt or
        ana.ctl for graphical output)

DIR STRUCTURE
1. ini: dir that contains a cold start initialization for an ensemble of
        initital inputs

2. truth: dir that contains an truth created from a base run of the baro model.
        This program will use an initial input and integrate the model with 
        time, output at some regular interval as the truth benchmark.


3. obs: dir contains the obs data that are created by running obs.exe. This 
        program will read the truth and add some perturbed white noise to
        the truth to mimic the real obs.

4. model: contains the barotropic model


5. 3dvar: contains the assimilation code that performs a data assimilation
        process using 3DVAR.

6. ana: contains the analysis backup

7. fsc: contains the forecast for each cycle.
